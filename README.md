# Raw Data Files

A zip file (data.zip) is included with all the raw data, with the exact names as referenced in the program. To use these datasources, please unzip the file and move the folder's contents into the working directory. 

The following data files are included in data.zip: 

Microarray data: healthy.csv, disease.csv (Singhania et al.); healthy63.csv, disease63.csv (Wenzel et al.); healthy65.csv, disease65.csv (Yang et al.).

Transcription factor data: tfdb.csv (curated from TFDB database)

Differentially Expressed Genes: degenes1.csv (results from MetaIntegrator)

More specific methodologies and full citations of these data files are outlined in Methods section of manuscript.

# Other

All analysis was performed with R version 3.6.0 on a 64-bit MacBook Pro with 8 GB RAM.
